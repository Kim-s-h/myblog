Hi there! I'm a PhD-trained statistician with over 10 years of experience in analyzing data arising from healthcare and social science research using advanced quantitative methods. My research interests include applications of statistics and machine learning in the healthcare and social sciences fields, communicating data through visualization, and teaching statistical concepts to a general audience. I work on projects that use electronic health record data to investigate risk factors for health outcomes 
and build clinical prediction models.

I enjoy learning new things, and am always looking for opportunities to apply what I've learned to my work and daily life.✨

I'm also passionate about both coffee and tea, and I have recently developed a love for specialty coffee. ☕
